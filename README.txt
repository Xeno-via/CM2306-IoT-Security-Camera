Hi! 
Welcome to Group 6's Security Camera Project
We have included some images in the dataset folder of Finn, these were the images taken in the demo video, which can be seen at: https://youtu.be/IeO_Xi8mUT8
We have also included some encryption keys which we used to connect to our own thingsboard account.
If you are implementing this on your own then these would need to be changed to your own keys / account.
If you would like to remove Finn from the dataset, then remove the images from the dataset folder, remove ",Finn" from the Names.csv folder, and change the latest_id.txt folder to be "0"
The requirements.txt file includes everything we had to install in order to run our project. 
Hope you like the project! If you need assistance you can email the project leader at finn@trowell.com
